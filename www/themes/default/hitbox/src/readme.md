This folder containts .fla & .as (AS2) sources needed for editing and compiling Flash hitbox.

hitbox.fla is saved with Adobe Flash Professional CS6, and as such may not be compatible with older Flash Professional software ( if anybody still has those).

Original source was made in Macromedia Flash Professional 8 by Stormtrooper.

We would appreciate if somebody could port this hitbox from Flash to a more modern web standard because Flash player has reached its End Of Life.
Right now, Flash hitbox is displayed by using flash emulator, but we would like to change that.

 
Thank you.
