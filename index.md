## Welcome to Drek's PsychoStats Repository

PsychoStats is the defining game stats software of the golden age of PC game modding, between the years of 2000 and 2005. It was created for the game and it's mods that dominated that golden age, Half-Life and Source, with mods like Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Earth's Special Forces, and so many others that there are truly too many to mention.

PsychoStats parses server logs and generates statistics based on those logs. Those statistics are stored in a database which is accessed by a web portal that displays those statistics. The stats parsing scripts are written in Perl while the web front end is written in PHP. This version of PsychoStats is working on PHP 7.4.11 and MariaDB 10.3.24.

All of the versions on this repository should be considered beta software as at this time I simply do not have the capacity or the access to game servers to thoroughly test releases. I know that prior to 2010 PsychoStats was tested on thousands of websites with logs from thousands of game servers. The base PsychoStats code should be robust and stable, and the changes I have made have been relatively minor, so it stands to reason that the code is still robust and stable, but I can make no guarantees.  Use this software at your own risk.

This version of PsychoStats currently supports the following games:
