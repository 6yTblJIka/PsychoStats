Introduction:

This is a collection of three child mod specific themes, one for Firearms, one for Natural Selection and one for TFC.  The cc_default parent theme is not mod specific.  The colour palette is based on the colours you find in a Ritz cracker.  The mod specific player pages are modded to include data specific to the mods.  Most of the images in the parent theme have been removed, and the few that remain have been highly optimized.  These themes should load faster and require less bandwidth than the PsychoStats default theme.  The header has also been removed which makes these themes ideal for displaying in an iframe on a website with it's own header.

Disclaimer:

As usual use this theme at your own risk.  I accept no responsibility for any damage it may do and make no claims regarding its functionality and security.  I think it will work, and I don't think there are any security issues, but that doesn't mean that it will work, or that there are no security issues.

Credits:

These are a modification of the default PsychoStats 3.2 theme, and as such most of the work has been done by Stormtrooper.  I have only modded them, and reworked the colours and the graphics.

Requirements:

A working PsychoStats >= 3.2 installation.

Installation:

To install simply unzip into your PsychoStats "themes" directory, and activate in the Themes section of the Admin cp (control panel).  The cc_default theme must be installed to install the child themes.
