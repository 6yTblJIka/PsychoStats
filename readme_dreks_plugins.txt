Drek's Plugin Pack

There are 9 plugins included here.  The following is a list of what they do.

mod_csw.php      - This plugin adds weapon class and skill weight columns to the weapons table.  The other plugins can also add this feature if you wish.  See below for details.

mod_csw_dods.php      - This plugin is designed specifically for Day of Defeat: Source, and adds weapon class and skill weight columns to the weapons table, as well as removing rounds played from the maps tables.

mod_ff.php       - This plugin removes friendly fire kills from the stats.

mod_hld.php      - This plugin removes hit location and damage stats from the stats for mods that don't have those stats available.

mod_hldff_ns.php - This plugin is designed specifically for Natural Selection and removes hit location, damage, friendly fire kills and rounds from the stats.  You can activate friendly fire in NS, but ff kills aren't logged.

mod_hld_tf.php   - This plugin is designed specifically for Team Fortress 2 servers with friendly fire enabled.  It removes hit location and damage stats from the stats but does not remove headshot kills.

To install simply unzip and place the appropriate plugin in your "[root web directory]/plugins" folder, then go into your admin cp (control panel), chose the Plugins tab, and activate the plugin.
