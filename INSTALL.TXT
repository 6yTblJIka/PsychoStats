= PsychoStats QUICK Installation =

== IMPORTANT ==

PsychoStats has two parts. The local Perl scripts in the 'root' folder that
do all the database updates and stats processing. And the PHP 'www' files that
make up the web front end that allow you to view the stats web pages on your
website.

The local 'root' files SHOULD NEVER BE located inside your website directory
tree.  If you put it somewhere where the webserver can access it then any user
on the Internet would be able to read your stats.cfg file and see your database
settings. You have been warned.

== QUICK INSTALLATION ==

1) If you've already unzipped the archive you will have a directory structure
that looks like this:

* \addons
* \root
* \scripts
* \www
** changelog.txt
** INSTALL.TXT
** license.txt
* readme_*.txt
* README.md

2) You will need a MySQL or MariaDB database, user and password.  If you don't
know how to set that up, Google is your friend.  It's fairly simple and there is
lots of information on how to do that on the web.  Make sure your user has full
permissions on the database.

You should not use a database super user for PsychoStats, especially in a production
context.  You should create a user then create a database, then make sure your user
has full permissions on that database, before you run the installer.  However, for test
purposes, in a local network environment you can use a database user with general
permissions and the installer will create the database for you.

3) You will need to have Perl installed to run the stats generation scripts, and
your web hosting will need to have PHP installed on it.  Note that there are a
number of Perl and PHP modules that you will need to have installed.  Again, Google
is your friend, if you encounter errors when you try to run the web install, or
when you run the stats generation scripts, those errors should let you know
what you need to install.

4) These instructions assume you already know the basics of hosting a website
The specifics of that will depend on your hosting arrangements.  Copy the contents
of the 'www' directory to your web hosting folder.  It is recommended that you
don't expose your PsychoStats web folder to the web until you have completed the
install process.

5) Browse to the stats installation wizard with your browser and follow the
instructions:
	http[s]://[domain|localhost]/[stats folder name if any/]install/

== IMPORTANT ==

The install process will automatically delete your install folder when it is completed.
If you need to run the install process again you will need to upload the install folder
to your PsychoStats web folder again.

6) The 'root' folder contains the heart of your PsychoStats.  You can put that anywhere
as long as your user has executable permissions and you can access your PsychoStats database
from that machine, other than a web accessible folder.  Edit the 'stats.cfg' in that folder
with your PsychoStats database name, user and password.

== Security Notes ==

Common sense is your best protection.  You want a distinct PsychoStats database user that
only has permissions on the PsychoStats database.  Never run the PsychoStats scripts as root
in Linux.  Never use your MySQL/MariaDB super user as your PsychoStats user.

The config.php and stats.cfg files contain your PsychoStats database user name and password,
once the config.php file has been written in the install process, and once you've entered your
information into the stats.cfg files, the respective users only need read access to them.

No other user should have permissions to read them, let alone write or execute them.

7) The stats are generated by running the 'stats.pl' script.  Once you have done that,
if you have heatmap support for your game/mod, you can run the heat.pl script to generate
the heatmaps.
