= PsychoStats QUICK Installation = 

For those that are too impatient follow the quick step guide below.

== Quick Note ==

PsychoStats has two parts. The local perl scripts that do all the database 
updates and stats processing. And the 'upload' files that make up all of the 
PHP files that allow you to view the stats web pages on your website. Anything
not in the 'upload' directory is considered a local file.

The only suggestion I can make is that the local files SHOULD NEVER BE 
located inside your website directory tree. If you put it somewhere where the 
webserver can access it then any user on the Internet would be able to read 
your stats.cfg file and see your database settings. You've been warned.

== QUICK INSTALLATION ==

1) If you've already unzipped the archive you will have a directory structure
that looks like this:

* \addons

* \root
* \upload
* \scripts
* \www
** changelog.txt
** INSTALL.TXT
** license.txt
* readme_*.txt
* README.md

2) You will need a MySQL or MariaDB database, user and password.  If you don't
know how to set that up, Google is your friend.  It's fairly simple and there is
lots of information on how to do that on the web.  Make sure your user has full
permissions on the database.

3) You will need to have Perl installed to run the stats generation scripts, and
your web hosting will need to have PHP installed on it.  Note that there are a
number of Perl and PHP modules that you will need to have installed.  Again, Google
is your friend, if you encounter errors when you try to run the web install, or
when you run the stats generation scripts, those errors should let you know
what you need to install.

4) These instructions assume you already know the basics of hosting a website
The specifics of that will depend on your hosting arrangements.  Copy the contents
of the 'www' directory to your web hosting folder.  It is recommended that you
don't expose your PsychoStats web folder to the web until you have completed the
install process.

5) Browse to the stats installation wizard with your browser and follow the
instructions:
	http[s]://[domain|localhost]/[stats folder name if any]/install/

6) The 'root' folder contains the heart of your PsychoStats.  You can put that anywhere
as long as your user has executable permissions and you can access your PsychStats database
from that machine.  Edit the 'stats.cfg' in that folder with the your Psychostats database
name, user and password.

7) The stats are generated by running the 'stats.pl' script.  Once you have done that,
if you have heatmap support for your game/mod, you can run the heat.pl script to generate
the heatmaps.
